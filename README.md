# Probability Distributions Fitting For Player Props

This script is an introduction to the concept of probability 
distributions in the context of player prop betting.

A stat might seem like it fits a common distribution (like 
Normal or Poisson), but testing it against actual data often 
reveals a better fit—like Negative Binomial or Gamma.

Picking the correct distribution helps us estimate the 
true probability of an outcome. And in sports betting, 
that’s the whole game: comparing your probability estimate 
to the price the sportsbook is offering.

This script shows how to:
 - Understand the types of distributions used in betting
 - Visualize their shapes and behaviors
 - Fit real NFL player data to different distributions
 - Use AIC/BIC to test which one fits best
